## Welcome!

Hello - I am Andrew Ireson, an associate professor at the University of Saskatchewan. I research and teach Hydrology. I come from the UK, and have lived in Saskatoon in Canada since 2011. I enjoy meeting people from all around the world, with different stories and cultures. I am married to Theodora, and we have two kids that keep us very busy - my family is very important to me. When I am not working or spending time with my family, I volunteer helping refugees in Saskatoon. My main objective is to help young people (18-30) to get access to higher education. 

If you are new to Saskatoon, welcome. You are in a very friendly and beautiful city. You will learn there are lots of good and some bad points about life in Saskatoon, and it is probably very different from where you come from. I have learned that living in Saskatoon can be fantastic if you make the effort to embrace the lifestyle, the weather and the people. You will have a better experience if you find the right neighborhood and house to live in. For young people, there are excellent educational opportunities here - there is no limit to what you can achieve with a highschool education from Saskatoon or a degree from the University of Saskatchewan.

I would be happy to talk to you. If you are interested in educational opportunities I can give you advice. And if you are specifically interested in studying at the [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.usask.ca/admission/), I am part of a team in the University that can help you to understand the process and make your application go smoothly.  

If you want to get in touch, send me an [email](mailto:amireson@gmail.com) with "RSSN" in the subject line.
