## About us

The RSSN is a volunteer lead group which seeks to help new refugees in Saskatoon to realize their potential through higher education. We seek to provide assistance with practical matters - how to submit applications, what English language qualifications are required, etc; and we seek to encourage our mentees to have the self-confidence to pursue the challenge of a degree program. For more information see the [about us](about) section.

If you just came here to sign up as a mentor, go [here]({% post_url 2023-04-01-mentoring %}).
