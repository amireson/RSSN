## About

This website provides English language learning activities. The activities are in two categories: conversation and English writing. These are intended for people that do not have access to school or other educational facilities. There are lots of free public learning resources on the internet - but what is different about this is that, if you register for this class (by completing the first [assignment](assignments/01)) you will receive feedback and grades. If you complete all assignments, you will receive a certificate of completion and a reference letter.

## Conversation 

We will host occasional meetings WhatsApp where participants can practice their English conversation. To join one of these classes, you must contact [Andrew](mailto:amireson@gmail.com) (or use WhatsApp).

## English writing 

In this intermediate written English course, you complete a number of writing assignments, which will be graded and given feedback. If you complete 10 assignments successfully you will receive a letter of completion. To begin this course and register, go here:
