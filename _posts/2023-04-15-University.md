### I have money worries now - how can I manage everything and go to University?

To deal with your money worries, you need to plan carefully. You need to understand what is and what is not possible and to do that, you need to make a budget. Write down all your expenses. Work out all your sources of income. Do this for the scenario where you work in a general job, and the scenario where you go to university. To do that, you need to understand how much university will cost and what sources of funding are available - jump to [here](#cost) to understand that.

You need to understand that your money worries are short-term worries. What I mean is - you need to pay your bills every month without going into debt or starving yourself. We say in Canada - you are living from paycheque to paycheque. However, if you only focus on your short-term money problems, you will never get out of this situation, and you will struggle with money forever.

The best way to get out of living paycheque to paycheque is to find a stable career that pays well, and to do that, you need to make yourself valuable to employers. You need a long-term plan. That means, you invest now in your education and skills so that you benefit in the future. This doesn't have to be a university education - there are other good options if you prefer to get skills for a trade. 

The important principle when it comes to money is, borrow money where that will bring you long-term benefits. Don't borrow money for short-term benefits - to buy a car or furniture. Instead of "buy now - pay later" (the Canadian religion) you should have the plan "pay now - benefit later".

:blue_car: vs :man_student: - the cost is about the same, so you decide which is your priority.
