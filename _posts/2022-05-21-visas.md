**TIME SENSITIVE: HELP NEEDED**

21-May-2022

Dear friends

We are trying to help the <a href="https://www.30birdsfoundation.org/">30 Birds Foundation</a> to secure 10-20 volunteers in Saskatoon, to help prepare visa applications for the girls and families that are hiding out in Pakistan. They are now in a very precarious situation and every day matters. We are asking for people to give 2 hours of their time, once or twice a week, to meet with the refugees over zoom (with a translator) and help fill out the paper work. This will be happening daily from 9.00 - 11.00 am Saskatoon time. Volunteers will be trained before this happens, and will need to have good written English. Farsi speakers will be very helpful too. Anyone that is able to help should email Andrew (<a href="mailto:amireson@gmail.com">amireson@gmail.com</a>), who will compile a list and forward to 30 Birds.

Please also share this request with your networks.

Thank you!

Andrew
